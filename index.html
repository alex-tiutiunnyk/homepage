                    <h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>
                      <p> I was born in warmth and comfort. The first days I was laying with my eyes closed next to my mother. 
                        Then I started trying to get on my feet. I was well fed, I liked my bed, from which I could see everything 
                        that happens in the living room.</p>

                    <h3>YOUTH</h3>
                        <p>It's so fun to get to know the world! Everything is so different. There are so many things that you want 
                          to sniff and bite. I also often play with my brothers and sisters in the yard. I have my favorite ball, 
                          with which I always go for walks.</p>

                    <p> My human had a little babies &#x1F476. At first I was confused and did not understand what was happening, 
                      but soon they became my friends. I help my human take care of them. They are so cute.</p>
